# the_tao_of_programming_translation_by_ChatGPT

From "The Tao of Programming" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tao_of_Programming)
NO, the translation is far from good.

## Book One: The Silent Void

### 1.1
#### Original

Thus spake the master programmer:
"When you have learned to snatch the error code from the trap frame, it will be time for you to leave."

#### Traditional Chinese
大程式設計師言：

「孰能學乎，悉得折陷阱幀，而能取誤代碼者，乃足以出矣。」

### 1.2
#### Original
Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. Waiting alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the source of all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of Programming.

If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great. If the operating system is great, then the compiler is great. If the compiler is great, then the application is great. The user is pleased and there exists harmony in the world.

The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of morning.

#### Traditional Chinese

有一物不可名，生於虛無，孤立而不動，為一而萬物之本。吾不知其名，故稱之曰程式之道。

若程式之道偉大，則作業系統偉大。若作業系統偉大，則編譯器偉大。若編譯器偉大，則應用程式偉大。用戶喜悅，天下融和。

程式之道，遠離而又返，如風之晨。

### 1.3
#### Original
The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to the assembler.

The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten thousand languages.

Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses the Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the Tao.

But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.


#### Traditional Chinese
道生於機器語言。機器語言生於汇编器。汇编器生於編譯器。今有萬般語言。

各語言皆有其用，然謙謙若也。各語言皆表示軟件之陰陽。各語言皆有其位於道之中。

然而若可避免，勿用COBOL程式。

### 1.4
#### Original
The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it. The average programmer is told about Tao and searches for it. The foolish programmer is told about Tao and laughs at it.

If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao.

The highest sounds are hardest to hear. Going forward is a way to retreat. Great talent shows itself late in life. Even a perfect program still has bugs.

#### Tranditional Chinese

智者得聞道而随之。中者得聞道而寻之。愚者得聞道而笑之。

若非笑也，道不存矣。

最高聲難聞。前行即退。大才晚發。即使完美程式亦有瑕疵。
