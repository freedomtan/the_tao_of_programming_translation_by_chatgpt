## Book One: The Silent Void

### Original
Thus spake the master programmer:
"When you have learned to snatch the error code from the trap frame, it will be time for you to leave."

### Traditional Chinese
大程式設計師言：

「孰能學乎，悉得折陷阱幀，而能取誤代碼者，乃足以出矣。」

### Original
Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. Waiting alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the source of all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of Programming.

If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great. If the operating system is great, then the compiler is great. If the compiler is great, then the application is great. The user is pleased and there exists harmony in the world.

The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of morning.

### Traditional Chinese

有一物不可名，生於虛無，孤立而不動，為一而萬物之本。吾不知其名，故稱之曰程式之道。

若程式之道偉大，則作業系統偉大。若作業系統偉大，則編譯器偉大。若編譯器偉大，則應用程式偉大。用戶喜悅，天下融和。

程式之道，遠離而又返，如風之晨。
